        I am a software engineering major with a minor in chemistry. I'm
        interested in web development because I like to build things that people
        can actually use and transform ideas into a working product. In my
        free time, I like to read, mainly mystery, thriller, mythology and
        fantasy and I'm also into console gaming. I've always been curious about
        pharmacy and forensics as well.
