        <h2>I am a software engineering major with a minor in chemistry. I'm interested in web development because I like to build things that people can actually use and transform an idea into a woking product. In my free time, I like to read, mostly mystery, thriller, mythology and fantasy and I'm also into console gaming. I've always been curious about pharmacy and forensics as well.   </h2>
